## JOS GitHub Repo Overview

### Areas of Focus

JOS repositories typically focus on:
- Audio signal processing and DSP algorithms
- Machine learning applications for audio
- Music technology tools and research
- Computational acoustics
- Physical modeling synthesis

### About Me

### Main Repositories Under Development

Most of my repos are git forks. When I fork a repo, I typically create
a `jos` branch first thing for my changes, merging `main`/`master`
into that over time.
